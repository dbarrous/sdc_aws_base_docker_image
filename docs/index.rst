Welcome to HERMES-SOC Docker Base Image documentation!
===============================================================

This is the documentation for the Base Image that will be used throughout the different *.devcontainer* repositories as well as the base image for the Lambda Processing function within the file processing pipeline. The image is built, tested and deployed automatically through a CI/CD Pipeline allowing anyone to make changes to the base image that lives in the public ECR repo. This documentation is intended to be used by developers who are interested in contributing to the project as well as those who'd like to know more about the project. The documentation is written in reStructuredText and built using Sphinx.

To learn more about contributing to the project, please see the `Developers Guide <dev-guide/index>` section.

If you'd like to know more about the project, please visit the project's `GitHub repository <https://github.com/HERMES-SOC/sdc_aws_base_docker_image>`_ page.
